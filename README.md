# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms Repository! 🎉🚀 This repository is dedicated to providing implementations of various data structures and algorithms using C, C++, and Java programming languages. It aims to help programmers learn and understand fundamental concepts in data structures and algorithms through practical examples and code snippets.

## Contents

The Data Structures and Algorithms Repository includes implementations of the following:

- Array-based data structures (e.g., arrays, dynamic arrays) 📚🔢
- Linked data structures (e.g., linked lists, doubly linked lists) 🔗🔀
- Stack and Queue ⏳🧱
- Trees (e.g., binary trees, AVL trees) 🌳🌲
- Graphs (e.g., adjacency matrix, adjacency list) 📊🔗
- Sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort, quicksort) 🔄🔢
- Searching algorithms (e.g., linear search, binary search) 🔎🔍
- Dynamic programming 📈🔄
- And more! 📚💡

Each implementation is accompanied by explanatory comments and, in some cases, usage examples to facilitate understanding and usage.

## Languages

This repository provides implementations of data structures and algorithms in the following languages:

- C
- C++
- Java

Feel free to explore the code in your preferred programming language.
